# Sigma

Sigma is a probabilistic programming environment implemented in Julia.
You can use it to specify probabilistic models as normal Julia programs, and perform inference.

# Installation

Sigma is built on top of Julia.  Sigma currently runs on linux only. Sigma is currently highly unstable, beware.
Install from a REPL with

```julia
Pkg.add("Sigma")
```

Sigma is then loaded with

```julia
using Sigma
```

# Usage

[Read the documentation](http://sigmajl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), look at the [examples](https://github.com/zenna/Sigma.jl/tree/master/examples), or see the quick start below.

# Quick Start
First we need to include Sigma

```julia
julia> using Sigma
```

Then, we create a uniform distribution ``x`` and draw 100 samples from it using ``rand``:

```julia
julia> x = uniform(0,1)
RandVar{Float64}

julia> rand(x, 100)
100-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.376264
  0.492391
     ...
```

Then we can find the probability that ``x^2`` is greater than 0.6:

```julia
julia> prob(x^2 > 0.6)
[0.225463867187499 0.225463867187499]
```
Then we can introduce an exponentially distributed variable ``y``, and find the probability that ``x^2`` is greater than 0.6 under the condition that the sum of ``x`` and ``y`` is less than 1

```julia
julia> y = exponential(0.5)
julia> prob(x^2 > 0.6, x + y < 1)
[0.053548951048950494 0.06132144691466614]
```

Then, instead of computing conditional probabilities, we can sample from ``x`` under the same condition:

```julia
julia> rand(x, x + y < 1)
0.04740462764340371
```
